CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is an automated software development method that brings various business impact benefits. Here is a summary of the key benefits:

1/Accelerated development speed: CI/CD shortens the software development time, enabling businesses to quickly bring new products to the market.

2/Ensured quality: Automated testing and continuous integration help identify errors early and ensure software quality.

3/Reduced risk: CI/CD minimizes the risks associated with software deployment and provides quick recovery capabilities in case of errors.

4/Increased flexibility and responsiveness: CI/CD allows businesses to adapt quickly to changes and customer requirements.

5/Improved interaction and customer feedback: CI/CD enables businesses to promptly respond to customer feedback and enhance their products based on that feedback.

6/Cost savings: Automating processes and reducing deployment time help minimize the resources and manpower required, resulting in cost savings in software development.

That summarizes the key benefits of CI/CD.
